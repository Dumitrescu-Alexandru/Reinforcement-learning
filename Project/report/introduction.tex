The field of reinforcement learning has always had many breakthroughs in trying to beat games. Backgammon, Chess, Go, even DOTA have lead to many innovations such as Deep Q Networks (DQN) \cite{Atari_Breakout}, Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) \cite{A3C} and many more.
The Atari 2600 game environments has a particular place in RL history as it was Deepmind's breakthrough paper that learnt to play games such as \textit{Breakout} and \textit{Pong} on a superhuman level.

\noindent
In this project we will utilize the Pong environment provided to us to try and train various agents using many RL frameworks to play the game effectively. We in particular explore the attempts in recreating the original Deepmind paper on and compare results with the more advanced Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) approaches.
